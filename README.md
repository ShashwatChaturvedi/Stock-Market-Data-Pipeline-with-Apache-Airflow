# Stock-Market-Data-Pipeline-with-Apache-Airflow
This project automates fetching Apple stock data from Yahoo Finance using Apache Airflow, storing it in MinIO as JSON. Spark processes JSON to CSV, stored again in MinIO. Data is ingested into PostgreSQL, then visualized in Metabase with a "Stock Market - AAPL" dashboard, showcasing seamless data pipeline integration.
